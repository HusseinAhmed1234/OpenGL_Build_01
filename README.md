# OpenGL_Build_01
This repository has an early vestion of Makefile build for OpenGL in Windows.
but you can't have a file with ".c" inside any folder other than src.
you can put files that has ".h" inside a folder if it's inside the folder "include" but remember to specify the path like " #include <glad/glad.h> ".
keep in mind that this is my first try at linking OpenGL so it may have problems I will try to perfect it later on.
